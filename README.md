# libft
## First project in school 42
### Comprehension C from scratch

In this project i implemented many functions from standard libraries like: **string.h**, **stdlib.h**, **stdio.h** ... etc. You may ask WHY? First of all it's a really good experience. Second is that in school 42 many of projects in general should be implemented using only: **malloc**, **free**, **write**, **exit**. Standard Functions. So if you write a bad **libft** this will affect future projects.

***
### Now I will show some basic functions that are often used by programmers in C
* [strlen](#strlen)
